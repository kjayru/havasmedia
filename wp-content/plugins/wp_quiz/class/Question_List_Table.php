     * specifically build for a given column. Generally, it's recommended to include
     * one method for each column you want to render, keeping your package class
     * neat and organized. For example, if the class needs to process a column
     * named 'title', it would first see if a method named $this->column_title()
     * exists - if it does, that method will be used. If it doesn't, this one will
     * be used. Generally, you should try to use custom column methods as much as
     * possible.
     *
     * Since we have defined a column_title() method later on, this method doesn't
     * need to concern itself with any column with a name of 'title'. Instead, it
     * needs to handle everything else.
     *
